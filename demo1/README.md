Demo 1
======

This is Demo 1 of the Rails SOLR Demo app that accompanies my presentation,
"Rails and the Apache SOLR Search Engine," which was first given at RubyNation
2012 in Reston, VA on March 24, 2012.

This app is a sort of "20-minute blog with search," as opposed to DHH's famous
"15-minute blog with Rails" of a few years ago. Demo 1 consists of some
scaffolding for blog posts, a search form and a Search Results page. I did a
few minor enhancements to make it look relatively nice, but not too much.
